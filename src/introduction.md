# Introduction

I am a failure. In fact, I am so good at it that I get paid to do it. I used to treat it as just a hobby. But, as a 
wise man once said, “If you’re good at something, never do it for free.”

My history of failure consciously starts in 1977 when I was awarded the 2nd to last medal in the Cub Scouts'
[Pinewood Derby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinewood_derby). _For the record, I was robbed. 
A rival scout master hammered the wheels on one of his kids cards to take last place. I complained, but the refs didn't
care. Lesson learned._

For years I struggled as a French Horn player, losing audition after audition as I performed for low pay and a series of
backwater orchestras around the country. (Backwater orchestras rule, BTW.) I did manage to earn my San Francisco Musician
Union card performing for a total of four minutes in  Gustav Mahler's 
[2nd Symphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._2_(Mahler)) and Richard Strauss' comically bad 
[Eine Alpensinfonie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Alpine_Symphony). 

Ironically, my worst experience as a musician was when I won first horn in the Cal State Honor Band back in high school. 
I came into the audition not giving a flying fuck, and strangely enough, nailed the audition. I was totally unprepared
psychologically for the effect of being completely ostracized by the other 11 players in the section. It was one of the
worst experiences of my life. Much more fun to just chill in the fourth horn section, like I did the year before. 
Strange how much better you perform when you simply do not care. 

I wish someone had explained to me back in one of the many colleges I dropped out of how one by far the most profitable
professions you can have on the planet is being a failure. 

The list of possible career choices for professional failures is truly mind-boggling:

* Real Estate Mogul
* Reality TV star
* President
* Politician
* Crypto Shill
* Startup Founder
* Motivational Speaker
* Faith Healer 
* AI Expert 
* AI Ethics Expert 
* Electric Car Company CEO
* Social Media Mogul
* CEO of company trying to get to Mars
* Pension Fund Manager
* Everyone on the payroll of the New York Knicks

Ironically, the professions that matter the most, such as nurses, teachers, and the people who pick all the food we eat,
are generally the ones that get paid the least. 

Me, I’m a software developer. _But, wait, Christoph… you’re saying… how can you be professional as a software developer
if you’re a failure?_ Great question, gentle reader. It’s simple, really. Here's the magic formula, or what us nerds call
algorithm:

1. Decide some thing that you want to accomplish with code.
2. Write a test validating that thing.
3. Make sure it fails.
4. Make it pass.
5. Make sure all your other tests pass.
6. Clean things up. 
7. Rinse/Repeat
8. …
9. Profit!

This is what is generally called Test Driven Development. Personally, I prefer to say that I fail for a living.

Now, here's the thing... in fact, this thing is the secret to life. There are two critical things that you need to do
in order to profit off of failing:

* Fail as fast as you can
* Learn from your failures

## Fail as fast as you can

You will fail. Every system fails. The critical thing is when. You can fail when you decide to postpone a launch of your 
fancy spacecraft because your engineers worn you that the heat shields on your rockets have this nasty habit of falling
off, OR you can decide to ignore the big brains on your staff, and go ahead with the launch only for most children in
your country watch as your rocket carrying the first teacher in space explodes live on national television.
Lesson learned, one way or the other.

Typically, the cause of these epic fails is some stuffed shirt thinking that they know better than all those loser 
scientists on things like designing a submarine to go to the bottom of the ocean. So kids, if you're going to fuck 
around, try to find out as soon as you can; not 10,000 feet underwater. 

## Learn from your failures

Every failure is, potentially, a gift. Potentially, because you have to take the time to actually learn from your
mistake. Not taking the time is one of the surest ways to compound the failure with more fails. 

One of the most toxic environments that I look out for professionally is what I call blame cultures. For example: 
there's this company that has for many years had a very thriving business model that virtually prints money. Slowly, 
over time, their market share has been eroding by competition not burdened by their antiquated infrastructure. 

In order to encourage quality in their software, they instituted an interesting bonus structure for their developers:
The fewer defects your team had, the higher your bonus would be. Strangely enough, rather than improving the quality
of their systems, the company had created a financial incentive for everyone to simply downplay and ignore problems.
Surprise, surprise, their systems are a jumbled rat's nest of intertwined systems, where the more they try to improve
them, the worst they get. (_This is a commonplace situation._)
